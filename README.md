# tf_text_classify
The classic exploration of movie reviews data with machine learning using TensorFlow and Keras. This is based on a tutorial in the Tensor Flow documentation. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7+ (or Python 3), this example uses 2.7.14 as I type this
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy

What I've done here and I recommend you do as well is to install Python via Anaconda. Anaconda comes with all of the packages mentioned above already installed. 
* [Anaconda installation guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install)

If you already have Anaconda installed, make sure you have the most updated version. If you don't know which package you are on, or if you are just feeling lazy, type `$ conda update` and it will return what you should type into your command line to update Anaconda.

### Getting started

- Start a new file and name it (for example your_file_name.py)
- Follow the instructions in the tf_text_classify.py file that appear to the right of the # symbols

## Built With
